# rust_sliding_window_word_counter
This is a rust program which scans any standard Fasta file and outputs the count of each 3 letter word.

Make sure you have rust installed.

There is a sample complete genome of Salmonella enterica named sequence.fasta within the file, but will ask the user for any file path for a fasta file to read. Any fasta file should work.

To download run:

```git clone https://github.com/TrStans606/rust_sliding_window_word_counter```
